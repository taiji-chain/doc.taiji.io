It is accessible by the [light-blockchain-4j][] command line only at the moment. For more detail, please refer to [Taiji client][].

We are building a web client at the moment, and it should be ready for testing in weeks. If you want to try the command line and help us to test, please create an address with the command line and send me an email so that I can transfer Taiji coins to you for testing. Please be aware that the address you created for testnet can be used for mainnet as well and I will put your address in the Genesis distribution.txt in https://github.com/taiji-chain/contribution to award your effort once the mainnet is up and running.
