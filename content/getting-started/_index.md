Currently, there is only one Java command line console available to interact with the taiji blockchain, and we are working on other clients at the moment. 

There three ways to run the command line console. 

- [Compile from the source code][]
- [Download the packaged application][]
- [Run from Docker container][]


[Compile from the source code]: /getting-started/source-code/
[Download the packaged application]: /getting-started/standalone/
[Run from Docker container]: /getting-started/docker-command/
