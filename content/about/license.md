The core, client, and plugins are all open sourced with [Apache 2.0][] license. 

The chain-writer, chain-reader, and token-reader are not open sourced to the public but open sourced to our partners who are operating the public Taiji Blockchain and enterprise customers who are running private Taiji Blockchain on-premise or on the cloud. These services are the guards for the blockchain and will only be open sourced when we feel comfortable. 

We provide the Taiji Blockchain for the enterprise customers with commercial license and support.
