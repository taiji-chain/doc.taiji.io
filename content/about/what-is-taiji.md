Taiji (simplified Chinese: 太极; traditional Chinese: 太極; pinyin: tàijí; literally: "great pole") is a Chinese cosmological term for the "Supreme Ultimate" state of undifferentiated absolute and infinite potential, the oneness before duality, from which Yin and Yang originate.

For every transaction on the blockchain, there is always debit (Yin) and credit (Yang) in the ledger. We split these into multiple subchains for an inter-chain transaction or in the same subchain if all addresses in the transaction belong to the same [home bank][]. 


### Who should use the public Taiji Blockchain?

* For users who are looking for a fast and low-cost cryptocurrency for everyday transactions. 

* For merchants who are looking for a service provider for low cost batched payment solutions.

* For financial institutions to join the network as a bank to operate a subchain. 

* For companies who want to build a distributed application on a blockchain platform. 

* For investors who want to invest security tokens for future profit. 

* For developers who want to mine the tokens by contributing to the project. 


### Who should use the private Taiji Blockchain?
