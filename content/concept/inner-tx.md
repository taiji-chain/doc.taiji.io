Inner chain transaction means that both sender and receiver addresses belong to the same [subchain][]. 

For example, if sender's address is `0000344d315050CA9B0938B6511EC342705a1f9c` and the receiver's address is `000050f134b8B0Db3D9Cc3F6cB262D4d4445Ee28` then the transaction is inner chain transaction as both address belong to the sub chain with Id `0000`. 

For inner chain transaction, the transaction fee will be significantly less than the [inter chain transaction][].
