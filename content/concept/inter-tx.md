Inter chain transaction means that sender's address and receiver's address belong to two different [subchain][]. 

For example, if sender's address is `0002c1D28a71cfAd10Da78013930663271655c3d` and receiver's address is `00012281Ecf658dD64F0562147bd55FFc4e2F2b3` then it is a inter chain transaction. 

The cost of inter chain transaction will be higher than a inner chain transaction as the credit ledger must be written to the other subchain to complete the transaction.
