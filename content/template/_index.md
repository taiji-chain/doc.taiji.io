To build and deploy distributed applications on Taiji Blockchain is very similar to writing smart contracts on other blockchains. However, it is much safer to create a distributed application on the Taiji Blockchain as we provide application templates for each kind of application and all building blocks as plugins. These building blocks are open sourced and tested by the community with fewer bugs than writing everything by yourself from scratch. 


Here is the list all the application templates provided by the community. 

- [ERC20 Token](/template/erc20-token/)
- [Authentication and Authorization](/template/id-auth/)
- [KYC - Know Your Client](/template/kyc/)
- [Reference Data](/template/reference/)
- [Host Menu](/template/host-menu/)
- [Schema Form](/template/schema-form/)
