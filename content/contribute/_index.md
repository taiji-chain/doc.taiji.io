The Light Platform and Taiji Blockchain relies heavily on the enthusiasm and participation of the open-source community. We need your support in its development, documentation, examples, and tutorials. In addition to above activities, opening issues on github.com and asking questions on gitter rooms help the team to improve the products and help other members to learn how to use the platform.
